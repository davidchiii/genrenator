Practice using machine learning techniques to categorize music samples into their respective genres.

Initial analysis using Neural Networks:
- vary weights and intermediary hidden nodes
- 80/20 training-validation set
- utilizes [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html)

Secondary analysis with SVMs:
- TODO!
